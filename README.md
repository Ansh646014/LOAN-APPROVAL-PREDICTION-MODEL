# LOAN-APPROVAL-PREDICTION-MODEL
this loan approval prediction model is a machine learning based project which has tested multiple algorithms of machine learning and then chose the best two for the final result the overall accuracy ios around 80-81% and the data set used here is taken from kaggle here is the link-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication
the data obtaind from kaggle was first cleaned then analysed feature engineering were applied to improve overall accuracy.
The algorithms like logistic regression, Random forest, Naive Bayes and support vector machine
EDA is appplied for data analysis
